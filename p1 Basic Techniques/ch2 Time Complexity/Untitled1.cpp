// Time Complexity

/*
Analysis of Time is important, we have Best, Average & Worst case
Notation like Big-Oh or O() ara asymptotic not connected directly with above 3 cases
2*n = O(n**2) ;  has no connection with Worst case, but a mathematical concept
*/

/*
LOOPS
k-nested loops, each executed n times has complexity O(n**k)
Let k1,k2 are some constants, n can be replaced with (n+k1),
step size can be k2 not just 1, still complexity remains same
due the fact, that n is considered to be very large theoretically

PHASES/PARTS
if sequentially there are 3 phases, complexity is taken from most complex phase/part

MULTI-VARIABLEl if 2 nested loop, but one is m times & other is n times, O(m*n)

RECURSION
Dependent on complexity of each call & number of times call is made
(This need to be practised, Solving recurrence relation techniques and Master's theorem)

NP-HARD:     problems with no polynomial time solution known
NP-COMPLETE: NP-Hard, when can't prove non-existence of polynomial solution
