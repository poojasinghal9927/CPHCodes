// Dynamic Programming
/*
Dynamic programming is a technique that combines the correctness of
complete search and the efficiency of greedy algorithms.
Dynamic programming can be applied if the problem can be divided into
overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.
There are two uses : Finding Optimal Solution, Counting Number of Optimal Solutions

Basic idea is to find overlapping subproblem, which we need to find in application
Top down uses map for storage of memo & hence coding wise easy, bottom up has low constants

1.  Coin exchange problem
2.  Longest Common Subsequence
3.  Longest Increasing Subsequence
4.  Maximum weight path to to reach diagonally opposite in 2D array
5.  0-1 knapsack problem
6.  Edit distance
7.  Counting Tiling
8.  Rod cutting
9.  Matrix Chain Multiplication
10. Weighted Job Scheduling
